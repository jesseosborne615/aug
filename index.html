    <div class="words"
    <p1>When I am good and sober<br>Maybe you'd like to come over<br>And I'll sing a song I wrote about<br>
        How I don't wanna live without<br>You right there by my side<br>Not just a dream behind closed eyes<br>
        But right up close<br>Because it's hard to sleep alone<br>
        Like how love needs kerosene<br>I needed you and I hope you needed me<br>
        But like rabid dogs without a home<br>Our minds are dangerous and like to roam<br>
        To all these places that they shouldn't go<br>And I don't think that they should ever be alone<br><br>
        But nothing's ever happened<br>That cannot be undone<br>Yea we'll feel better<br>When August comes
